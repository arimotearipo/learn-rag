### Barry

Barry was footballer who used to play as a striker in the Malaysian football league.
Throughout his career, he scored a total of 1732 goals for Sungai Petani FC.
Eventually, he retired at the ripe age of 34.
After retiring, Barry decided to settle down in Kampung Parit Busuk, Perak.
One day, Barry's home was mistaken by a bunch of loan shark as the address of a defaulter.
Barry's home was burned and Barry's car was stolen.
Barry wanted to take revenge on the loan sharks so he joined the US Military to get some combat training.
After 1 year of training, he came back to Malaysia and tracked down the loan shark.
He managed to locate the headquarter of the loan shark. He ambushed the headquarter and killed 25 henchmen with a pencil sharperer in the process.
After climbing up the stairs 23 floor high, he managed to get to the loan shark's boss's office.
He kicked the door down and he was ready to kill the loan shark boss. But as it turns out, the loan shark's boss is actually a talking dolphin that is dying and begging to be put back into water.
Feeling bad, barry decided to take dolphin into the car and he drove to the nearest beach.
After arriving, he dumps the dolphin back into the water only for the dolphin to get caught in a fisherman's net.
Barry thought that it was something out of his control so Barry just said "Tough luck" to the dolphin as he watches the dolphin being dragged away by the fishermen.
